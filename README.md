# Week 3 workshop - Code review

The task this week is described in the Jupyter notebook `week03_codereview.ipynb`.

This week, for the first time, there are no specific indications of what the driver and navigator should do. Choose someone to be the driver first, and **switch roles every 15-20 minutes**. The task this week should involve quite a bit of discussion, so the driver should be the person running code and typing -- but try to think about the questions as a group.
